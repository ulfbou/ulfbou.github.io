# Introduction to Blazor

## Overview

Blazor is a new web framework that changes the way you develop web applications. With Blazor, you can write your client-side logic in C# and share your code with your server-side logic. This means you can write your entire web application in C# and run it in the browser without any plugins.

## Getting Started

To get started with Blazor, you need to install the Blazor SDK. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates
```

Once you have installed the Blazor SDK, you can create a new Blazor project by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet new blazor -o MyBlazorApp
```

This will create a new Blazor project in the `MyBlazorApp` directory.

## Components

Blazor applications are built using components. Components are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces. Components can be written in C# or in Razor syntax.

Here is an example of a simple Blazor component written in C#:

```csharp
public class HelloWorld : ComponentBase
{
	protected override void BuildRenderTree(RenderTreeBuilder builder)
	{
		builder.OpenElement(0, "h1");
		builder.AddContent(1, "Hello, World!");
		builder.CloseElement();
	}
}
```

And here is the same component written in Razor syntax:

```razor
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

## Conclusion

Blazor is a powerful new web framework that allows you to write your client-side logic in C# and share your code with your server-side logic. With Blazor, you can write your entire web application in C# and run it in the browser without any plugins. If you are looking for a modern web framework that is easy to use and powerful, Blazor is a great choice.
