## Introduction to Zentient Framework

**Zentient Framework** is a modern, modular foundation for .NET applications — designed to help you build scalable, maintainable, and testable systems with ease.

- **Modular by design**: Core functionality is separated into individual components within the mono-repo, enabling you to adopt only the modules you need.
- **Extensible architecture**: Clean abstractions and layered design promote flexibility and future growth.
- **Unified tooling & samples**: The mono-repo includes configs, tools, sample projects, and validation endpoints to get you started quickly.
