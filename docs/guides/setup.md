# Local setup

Follow these two quick steps to get started.

## Install prerequisites

- .NET SDK 7+  
- Node 18+ (optional for tooling)  
- `docfx` CLI installed globally or available in CI

## Build commands (CLI-first)

```bash
# generate metadata (validate front matter)
docfx metadata

# build with strictness: treat warnings as errors
docfx build --warningsAsErrors
