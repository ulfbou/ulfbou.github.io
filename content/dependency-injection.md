# Dependency Injection

## Introduction 

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows you to decouple the creation and use of objects in your application. This makes your code more modular, testable, and maintainable. In this article, we will explore how to use dependency injection in Blazor applications.

## Overview

Dependency injection is a technique that allows you to inject dependencies into your classes rather than creating them inside the class. This makes your classes more modular and easier to test. In Blazor, you can use the built-in dependency injection container to inject services into your components.

## Getting Started

To use dependency injection in Blazor, you need to register your services with the built-in dependency injection container. You can do this in the `Program.cs` file of your Blazor application. Here is an example of how to register a service:

```csharp
public class Program
{
	public static async Task Main(string[] args)
	{
		var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
		builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");

		builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();

		await builder.Build().RunAsync();
	}
}
```

In this example, we are registering a service called `MyService` with the interface `IMyService`. This allows us to inject `IMyService` into our components.

## Injecting Services

Once you have registered your services, you can inject them into your components using the `Inject` attribute. Here is an example of how to inject a service into a component:

```csharp
@page "/counter"

@inject IMyService MyService

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p>Current count: @count</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Increment</button>

@code {
	private int count;

	private void IncrementCount()
	{
		count++;
	}
}
```

In this example, we are injecting the `IMyService` service into our component using the `Inject` attribute. We can then use the service in our component to perform operations. 

## Conclusion

Dependency injection is a powerful design pattern that allows you to decouple the creation and use of objects in your application. In Blazor, you can use the built-in dependency injection container to inject services into your components. This makes your code more modular, testable, and maintainable. If you are looking to improve the design of your Blazor applications, consider using dependency injection.
